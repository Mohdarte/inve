====================
The Mohdarte project's purpose is to develop tools for creative people using AI. 
Rather than using AI to try to replace genuine creativity I think that it can be 
used to make better tools for creative people to use. In this repository is the code
for the web-based digital painting tool Mohdarte Inve.
===========================
How to use the application
===========================
The HTML file can be launched in any browser and is fully functional for digital painting and basic editing. 
It comes with the features of a dynamically expandable canvas, many basic painting functions, and some more advanced yet simple
and intuitive features for making digital painting easy to grasp.
